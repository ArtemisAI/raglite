Given a high-level task title and description, set up a new development task by:

1. Creating a new folder under `.shared-resources/.tasks/` named after the task.
2. Investigating the issue context and summarizing background and objectives.
3. Breaking down the work into clear, detailed requirements and acceptance criteria.
4. Drafting documentation in `.shared-resources/.instructions/` outlining the problem, plan, and steps.
5. Preparing any necessary scripts or config files (e.g., workspace settings, tasks.json) to implement the solution.
6. Writing test stubs to validate the implementation approach.
7. Committing all artifacts with descriptive commit messages, updating any project-level configs.

Output all file creations, edits, and commit summaries that realize the above. 
Start by acknowledging the task title and confirming the plan outline.
