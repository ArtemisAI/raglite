## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to contribute to RAGLite. They clone the repository from GitHub and need to set up a complete development environment with optimal configuration for their specific hardware (CPU-only, NVIDIA GPU, AMD GPU, or Apple Silicon). The installation system should automatically detect their hardware capabilities, install the most appropriate dependencies, configure the environment with optimal settings, and validate that everything works correctly - all with a single command execution.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a fresh Ubuntu system with NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, **When** user runs `./install.sh`, **Then** system detects CUDA 12.1, installs PyTorch with CUDA support, llama-cpp-python with CUDA acceleration, configures optimal VRAM settings, creates virtual environment, and completes with GPU validation tests passing.

2. **Given** a macOS system with Apple M2 chip, **When** user runs `./install.sh`, **Then** system detects Apple Silicon architecture, installs PyTorch with Metal support, llama-cpp-python with Metal acceleration, configures ARM64-optimized dependencies, and validates Metal GPU functionality.

3. **Given** a Windows system with AMD GPU, **When** user runs `install.ps1`, **Then** system detects ROCm-compatible GPU, installs PyTorch with ROCm support, configures AMD-specific optimizations, and validates ROCm functionality.

4. **Given** a CPU-only Linux system, **When** user runs `./install.sh`, **Then** system detects absence of GPU, installs CPU-optimized PyTorch, configures fallback embedding models, and validates CPU-only functionality.

5. **Given** a system with insufficient Python version (3.9), **When** user runs installation script, **Then** system provides clear error message with specific upgrade instructions and fails gracefully.

6. **Given** a system with network connectivity issues, **When** package downloads fail, **Then** system retries with alternative mirrors, provides clear error messages, and offers offline installation options.

7. **Given** a user selects interactive installation mode, **When** prompted for optional features, **Then** system presents clear feature selection interface, explains each option, and installs only selected components.

8. **Given** installation completes successfully, **When** user runs validation tests, **Then** system verifies core functionality, GPU acceleration (if available), database connectivity, and provides comprehensive status report.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPU drivers are installed but incompatible versions (e.g., CUDA 11.8 with CUDA 12.x drivers)?
- How does system handle partial installations that were interrupted?
- What occurs when virtual environment creation fails due to permissions?
- How does system respond to corrupted package downloads?
- What happens when system has multiple GPU types (NVIDIA + Intel integrated)?
- How does system handle systems with insufficient disk space or memory?
